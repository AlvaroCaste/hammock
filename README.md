Hammock is yet another HTTP client for Scala. It tries to differentiate from other libraries with the follwing:

1. It's easy to use, has a high level API
2. ~It's library agnostic~ Will be library agnostic.
3. It tries to follow the _Bring Your Own Concurrency Monad_ pattern.
4. It has good documentation.
